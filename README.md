## About Me

Welcome! I'm Jack Kamataris, a double major in Robotics Engineering and Electrical & Computer Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). My work lies at the exciting intersection of software and hardware, focusing on creating innovative solutions for complex engineering challenges.

## Technical Expertise

  - Programming: Proficient in Python, C, C++, C#, Verilog, and VHDL with strong foundations in Object-Oriented Programming, large-scale software integration, gate-level programming, and hardware-software co-design for complex systems.
  - Hardware Development: Experience with STM32 microcontrollers, ESP32 development, FPGA development (Basys 3, Terasic DE10-Nano, Xilinx boards), and Raspberry Pi for hardware-software integration (ranging from Pi Pico to Raspberry Pi 5).
  - Coil Systems Design: Designed advanced coil systems capable of eliminating magnetic fields down to 0 nT for use in magnetically sensitive environments such as quantum research and medical imaging, utilizing mathematical and physics-based simulations.
  - Robotic Automation: Developed precise and reliable robotic systems for automation, combining software efficiency with robust hardware design. Also completed extensive work in the dynamic control of 4DOF systems.

## Projects
### Some of my notable projects include:

  - Major Qualifying Project: Designed and implemented coil systems for precise magnetic field control, collaborating with leading research institutions to enable breakthroughs in quantum research.
  - Summer Internship: Designed and constructed a full-scale non-magnetic room enclosure to house 12 moving Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) measuring 1.5mÂ² in size.
  - Robotic Endoscopic Imaging System: Currently developing a robotic system with advanced articulation and imaging for improved navigation in surgical procedures, using soft robotics and advanced materials.
  - Thermocoupling Solution: Created a system for monitoring heat during high-voltage Tesla Coil applications (tens of kilovolts) to prevent potential hardware damage.
